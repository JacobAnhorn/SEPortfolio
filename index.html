                    <p class="text-faded">At TDAmeritrade I was assigned the task of updating multiple UI's that were used within the business.  These projects taught me many thing such as communication within a professional team, paired programming, proper communications with a business partner, as well as SQL and Java Spring.  In weekly meetings with my manager I was praised for my ability to communicate effectively as well as my grasp on concepts that affected more than just my project.  At the end of my internship I presented my works to multiple managers across 4 different locations as well as the other summer interns.</p>

                    <p class="text-faded">My primary duty at TeamQuest was to help develop their automated testing framework.  This being my first internship taught me day-to-day business practices that I was to follow.  I also got my feet wet with Agile methodology at TeamQuest.  The automated testing framework itself was built in Ruby using the Selenium WebDriver, both technologies I had no former experience with coming into TeamQuest.  In my evaluations with my manager she told me that I had taken a roll that she hadn't seen another intern take in the fact that I communicated well with my other team members immediately, as well as helped get other team members up to speed as to what we were doing with the testing framework.  While I was not asked to give an overall final presentation to my manager, I was asked to present what we currently working on to other company members to give them idea as to where the project was heading.</p>

                        My current goal as a Software Engineer is to acquire a full-time position within a company that I feel I would enjoy and could take pride working for.  At said job I would like to be able to continue my growth and development as a Software Developer.  This development could come in many places such as company driven employee development sessions, or outside of work activites.  As far as long term goals go, I would like to eventually be able to transition into a mangerial role.  I was told at a previous internship that my ability to communicate with others is one of my strongest assets, and that it could potentially help with the transition.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My general education electives allow me to think about a problem more creatively than other engineers may. While I embrace my technical mindset and leverage it to my advantage, I understand that there is more than one way to approach nearly any problem.  Not only have they taught me to embrace other trains of thought, but my general education electives have taught me how to communicate more effectively.  General education classes help me think about engineering problems from many different angles as I attempt to apply different thought processes to each problem until the most logical one is found.  
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        One specific instance where I used the skills that I have gained from my general elective courses to aid in the completion of an engineering problem was at TD Ameritrade.  Although we were utilizing the waterfall development style for software I met and communicated with my business parters regurlarly, adapting a semi-agile methodology.  Having strong verbal skills that I was able to develop through my Speech Communications class helped me to change the process that I was using to get regular feedback from my business partner.  This kind of innovation is what allows teams, business, and people in general to grow.  Using a mesh between technical and general innovation can allow for growth in nearly every aspect of a business as well as the individual.

                    <p>Iowa State University has prepared me to be a well rounded engineer.  Throughout my time here I have learned how to develop systems from the ground up, solve a vast array of engineering problems, and view the broader spectrum that engineering problems can affect.  In many of my courses we have focused on the different elements that make up different systems be it how they are designed, how the pieces of the system interact, or what will be needed to develop said system.  We have also focused on a wide array of different engineering problems and many different approaches to said problems.  Finally, the experience I have gained outside of my core classes has allowed me to gain a wider perspective as to how engineering solutions impact society.  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                      Throughout my time at Iowa State I have been asked to work amongst others nearly every semester.  This has taught me many valuable skills when it comes to working in a team environment such as how to communicate effectively within a team, how to avoid conflict, and how to ... .  Being part of clubs has helped me to identify contemporary issues and how to avoid them.  Being an officer of a club on campus I have had to resolve a few issues that happened to occur.  Being a club officer has also helped me understand some professional and ethical responsibilites.  The same can be said for working in teams as often as I have.  You must be a proffesional first and foremost amongst peers as well as coming up with ethical and viable solutions to problems at hand.  
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    In many of my tasks assigned in class I utilized outside resources to help complete said task.  The two resources that I took advantage of most would have to be the library and other students.  The library had many online resources that guided me in the right direction on many assignments.  Other students helped me complete assignments when partners or groups were allowed.  The sharing of ideas with my peers allowed for more complete solutions as some points that they had covered I may not have and vice-versa.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    Many of the activities I partook in outside of the classroom have shown me how important it is to be constantly refining and developing my skills.  This could be shown by the Hackathon, as there is a plethora of ideas that could be made, and countless ways to create each idea.  The simple fact that their exists so many various solutions to one problem shows that there is much learning to be done for me.  Outside of that the career fair was another influence that reinforced the importance of lifetime learning to me.  While many employers look for a basic set of skills, each employer is looking for something unique that another employer may not be looking for.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                      Outside of the classroom I have begun working on smaller side projects to continue my learning in areas that have not been covered in class.  In these projects I have been developing with languages or frameworks that are foreign to me to help broaden my knowledge.  I believe that as I pick up on these new frameworks and languages it will help to continue building my confidence in taking risks in trying new things.  Simply developing using languages and frameworks that I have little to no experience has some sort of small risk as there is no guarantee that it will be the most efficient solution, but the knowledge gained from the end result is invaluable. 
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                      If I were to redo my time here at Iowa State I believe that I would have done many things the same as I had done them.  If I were to do one thing different it would be to socialize amongst my peers more.  While I have been in many successful groups, I believe that I could have gone outside of those groups and met many other people.  I have been praised for my social skills by previous employers and I believe that that is something that I could have leveraged more throughout my college career.
